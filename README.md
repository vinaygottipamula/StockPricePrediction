# Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning and Deep Learning

## Description

This project focuses on predicting stock prices using machine learning and deep learning techniques, particularly utilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The goal is to create an accurate model that can forecast future stock prices based on historical data.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- Python 3.x
- numpy
- yfinance
- scikit-learn
- keras
- matplotlib
- streamlit

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install numpy yfinance scikit-learn keras matplotlib streamlit
```

### Usage

Run the main script to launch the stock price prediction application:
```bash
streamlit run stock_prediction_app.py
```
